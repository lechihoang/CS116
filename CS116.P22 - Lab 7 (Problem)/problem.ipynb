Cụ thể, chúng ta sẽ tập trung vào các thuật toán Gradient Boosting như ***XGBoost***, ***LightGBM*** và ***CatBoost***. Chúng ta cũng sẽ tìm hiểu về cách kết hợp chúng bằng kỹ thuật Ensemble để cải thiện hiệu suất dự đoán."

    "Trong notebook này, chúng ta đã tìm hiểu về các phương pháp không nằm trong bộ sklearn như XGBoost, LightGBM và CatBoost, những mô hình thông dụng trong các cuộc thi trên Kaggle để đạt được độ chính xác cao. Chúng ta đã thực hiện các bước cơ bản từ tiền xử lý dữ liệu, huấn luyện các mô hình, và đánh giá hiệu suất trên tập kiểm tra.\n",
    "\n",
    "Một số điểm quan trọng cần lưu ý:\n",
    "- XGBoost, LightGBM và CatBoost là các mô hình mạnh mẽ có thể mang lại kết quả tốt trên nhiều loại dữ liệu khác nhau.\n",
    "- Lựa chọn mô hình thường dựa trên thử nghiệm và kiến thức về từng thuật toán. XGBoost thường là một lựa chọn tốt để bắt đầu, nhưng LightGBM và CatBoost có thể mang lại kết quả tốt hơn trong một số trường hợp.\n",
    "- Kỹ thuật Ensemble, như sử dụng `VotingClassifier`, có thể cải thiện độ chính xác của mô hình bằng cách kết hợp sức mạnh của các mô hình khác nhau.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hãy nhớ rằng để thành công trên Kaggle hoặc trong bất kỳ dự án Machine Learning nào, việc thử nghiệm và tinh chỉnh là quan trọng. Hãy luôn cân nhắc và tùy chỉnh phương pháp của mình để phù hợp với bài toán cụ thể và dữ liệu của bạn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chúc các bạn thành công trong việc tham gia các cuộc thi trên Kaggle và trong việc áp dụng Machine Learning vào thực tế!\n"
